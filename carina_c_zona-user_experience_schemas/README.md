# User Experience Schemas

The emergence of social app development is challenging us to code for users' personal world. Many have begun to push back when ill-fitted assumptions about the nature of self-identity — whether their name, gender, sexual orientation, professional connections, heartfelt relationships, or other deeply-felt attributes.

How can we balance users' realities with an app's business requirements?

Facebook, Google+, and others are wondering too. The answer will surprise you.

Discover schemas' influence over business scope, codebase, and our own productivity as developers. You'll learn how to re-envision the mental and technical schemas that go to the soul of user experience. Inspire user engagement and newfound loyalty.  Generate emergent data insights, and pivot as soon as users do.

## Resources
I gave a related talk, "Schemas for the Real World" at GoGaRuCo 2012. [Video, slides, and audience notes are available via Lanyrd.](http://lanyrd.com/2012/gogaruco/sydft/).  User Experience Schemas expands on a those ideas, with a greater range of themes and examples.

## Reviews for "Schemas for the Real World"
  > "Carina Zona challenged us to rethink our schemas to better reflect the real world. Her insightful session highlighted the assumptions we make about the world, particularly about relationships and sexual identity, through our technical decisions. When designing our applications, we should focus on modeling the world as it is, and worry less about how we’ll store and query the data. We can extrapolate out this idea further when thinking about software design. Instead of viewing our applications as interfaces to a datastore, they should be interfaces to our world. Storing the data is the easy part, writing our applications so that they are flexible to our dynamic world is much harder."
